This module provides a generic bootloader as specified by VSCP specification.

/** @defgroup vscp_bootloader VSCP bootloader
 * Generic bootloader algorithm as specified by VSCP specification.
 *
 * 1. Determine whether
 *     a) the user force bootloader mode,
 *     b) an valid application is present and shall be started,
 *     c) the application jumped to the bootloader,
 *     d) no application is present.
 *
 * 2. Conditions for case a):
 *     - If the segment initialization button is pressed during power-up, stay in the bootloader.
 *     Go to step 6.
 *
 * 3. Conditions for case b):
 *     - The segment initialization button is released.
 *     - The boot flag in the persistent memory shall contain 0xAA for destination application.
 *     If all conditions met, jump to the application otherwise go to step 6.
 *
 * 4. Conditions for case c):
 *     - The hardware jumper is not set.
 *     - The boot flag in the persistent memory shall contain 0xBB for destination bootloader.
 *     If all conditions met, go to step 9.
 *
 * 5. Conditions for case d):
 *     - The segment initialization button is released.
 *     - The boot flag in the persistent memory shall contain anything else than 0xAA and 0xBB.
 *     If all conditions met, go to step 6.
 *
 * 6. Send a "new node online/probe" event, so that the programming tool knows the node is available now.
 *     Node id 0xFE is used!
 *
 * 7. If any "ACK probe" event is received, the node shall go to sleep mode, because the
 *     nickname is already used.
 *
 * 8. Wait (infinite) for the "enter bootloader" event. Only if the received nickname
 *     and GUID are equal to the internal ones of the node, validate the proposed programming
 *     algorithm.
 *     If the algorithm is supported, continue with next step, otherwise a
 *     "NACK enter bootloader" event will be sent.
 *
 * 9. Because the application already received the "enter bootloader" event and validated its
 *     parameters, a "ACK enter bootloader" event shall be sent back now in the bootloader.
 *     Send the flash block size (= flash page size) and the number of blocks as parameters.
 *
 * 10. Wait (infinite) for the "start block data transfer" event. If the proposed memory type
 *     is correct acknowledge it via "ACK start block data transfer" event otherwise via
 *     "NACK start block data transfer" event.
 *
 * 11. Now several "block data" events will be received, until the complete block is transfered.
 *     Every received block data shall be written to RAM buffer. After the last data is transfered,
 *     a CRC16-CCITT shall be calculated over the whole block. And an "ACK block data" event shall
 *     be sent with the calculated CRC as parameter.
 *
 * 12. If a complete block is received, wait for a "program block" event. This is the
 *     trigger to delete a flash page and write the block RAM buffer to the flash page.
 *     If the block is successful written, send an "ACK program block" event to confirm it.
 *     Otherwise send an "NAK program block" event.
 *     Note that before writing the first block to flash, write 0xFF to boot flag in the persistent memory.
 *     This shall be done here, because after this, there is no way back.
 *
 * 13. The next block shall be handled (go to step 10), except an "drop nickname/reset device" event
 *     is received. In this case the block programming operation shall be stopped.
 *
 * 14. Validate the application in the flash.
 *     If the application is valid, a "ACK activate new image" event shall be sent, the boot flag
 *     in the persistent memory shall be set to 0xAA and reboot the node.
 *     Otherwise "NAK activate new image" event shall be sent and the node shall go to sleep.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Unused bytes in a flash block shall be 0xFF.
 * - The host shall send always an image in the size of the whole application section.
 * - Because the AVR has flash pages, but the VSCP has blocks, both are considered as equal.
 * - If the programming procedure is aborted by "drop nickname/reset device" event
 *   the node reboots.
 *
 * Error codes:
 * 0   - Programming algorithm not supported
 * 1   - Memory type not supported
 * 2   - Bad block number
 * 3   - Invalid message
